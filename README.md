# Departmental Store Billing System

## Project Overview

This project, created on November 29, 2013, is a billing system for a departmental store. The primary goal of this system is to streamline the transaction process, making it more efficient and faster than previous systems. A departmental store is a retail establishment that offers a wide range of durable goods and products to meet consumer needs. Our billing system aims to provide an organized and user-friendly way to manage these transactions, ensuring accuracy and convenience for both store employees and customers.

## Motivation
